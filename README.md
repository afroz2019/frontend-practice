# 💻 HTML, CSS & JS Class Practice

This repository contains all my daily practice files from frontend development classes.  
I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch and using Git + GitHub to track my progress.

## 📅 Daily Folders

Each folder (like `2025-04-24/`) contains code written during that class.

## 📁 Topics

- `tables/` — All HTML table examples
- `forms/` — HTML forms (login, registration, etc.)
- `css-practice/` — CSS styling practice (coming soon)
- `js-practice/` — JavaScript basics and DOM (coming soon)

## 🚀 Why This Repo?

- To improve Git & GitHub skills
- To show my learning journey publicly
- To organize all frontend practice code in one place
